                <ol>
                <li>
                <p>Gap in Dedicated HR Roles: While possessing HR certificates and some HR-related tasks (talent acquisition, training) within broader roles, a dedicated HR specialist or manager role is not explicitly listed, which might require emphasizing how his supervisory experience translates directly to HR leadership.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                <p>Recent HTML Training: A significant number of HTML courses were completed in 2025, which might suggest a recent focus or upskilling in this area, but it's unclear how directly this aligns with a primary HR or Operations Quality role unless it's for reporting/dashboard development.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                <p>Varied Career Path: The career path includes roles like "Coordinator/Negotiator for acquainting new sites" at a construction company in 2007, which is less directly aligned with his current objective. This might require explanation to demonstrate a coherent career progression towards his stated objective.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                <p>Limited Detail on Specific HR Projects/Achievements: While HR responsibilities are mentioned within the Orange role, the CV could benefit from more detailed descriptions of specific HR projects, initiatives, or quantifiable achievements to showcase the impact of his HR knowledge.</p>

                <li>
                <p>Perception of Broad Experience vs. Deep Specialization: While versatile, some employers might prefer candidates with a more specialized and continuous career trajectory in core HR functions if they are seeking a highly specialized HR role.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                <p>Keeping Up with HR Technology and Trends: The HR landscape is rapidly evolving with new technologies and methodologies. While he has data analysis tools, continuous learning in other emerging HR tech (e.g., HRIS, AI in HR) will be crucial.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                <p>Economic Downturns: Economic instability can impact hiring, particularly for specialized roles, potentially increasing competition.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                <p>Industry-Specific HR Needs: Some industries may have highly specific HR requirements that his diverse experience might not directly address, requiring him to highlight transferable skills effectively.</p>
